## How to copy the project

You can choose to download the project as a zip-file to your computer by clicking the green button, or you can choose to copy it over to your own Github account by "forking" the repository.

Forking means that you copy, or clone, the entire repository into your own repository on Github. It's the preferred way of doing things. And it is easy too, you create an account with Github and then just visit our repository and click the button "fork" in the upper right menu. Done. 

You now have your own copied version of our repository. And in order to download it, you need to have Git installed on your computer. When installed you simply create a folder where you want all of your repositories to be, then open your terminal window and type in following command, remember to replace the URL with your own respository URL if your forked our repository.

'git clone https://github.com/hogskolan-i-boras/personel-ledger.git'

(On Mac you might have to add 'sudo' to the command)
